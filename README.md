# Algorithms
###### Algorithm - a finite sequence of strict instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

## Characteristics
* Complexity
  - Time - how much time does it take to complete?
  - Space - how much memory is required?
* I/O
  - Input - what is accepted by the algorithm?
  - Output - what is algorithm's result?
* Classification
  - Serial/parallel - ability to break down a problem into smaller sub-problems, in order to address each of them simultaneously
  - Approximate/exact - ability to produce a known predictable value 
  - Deterministic/non-deterministic - ability to provide a solution through a series of consistent guesses (which become more accurate over time)

## Common algorithms
* Searching - find specific data in a larger data structure
  - Foo
* Sorting - arrange the data set in a certain order
  - Bar
* Computational - derive a different set of data from the original one
  - Bux
* Collection - manipulate/navigate among sets of data stored within particular data structure
  - Buz
